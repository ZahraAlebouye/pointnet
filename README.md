# PointNet from Scratch in PyTorch (Google Colab)

This project is a clean **from-scratch implementation of the PointNet architecture** for 3D point cloud classification using **PyTorch**.

The work has been entirely done and tested on **Google Colab**, allowing for easy replication and GPU acceleration without local setup.

## üöÄ Project Overview

- Implemented **PointNet** as described in the original paper:
  > [PointNet: Deep Learning on Point Sets for 3D Classification and Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593)
  
- Built the architecture **modularly** with separate blocks:
  - Input Transform Network (T-Net)
  - Feature Transform Network (T-Net)
  - Shared MLP layers
  - Global feature extraction (Max pooling)
  - Classification head

- Trained and evaluated on the **ModelNet40 dataset**, fully inside **Google Colab**.
